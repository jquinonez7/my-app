# Jade Quinonez — Portfolio Website  

Welcome to my personal portfolio site: https://www.jadequinonez.com/  

## 🚀 What This Is  
This website showcases my projects, skills, and contact information in one place. It’s meant to serve as a living résumé: browse my work, and see what I’ve built.

## 🔍 Why I Built It  
- To provide a polished, centralized home for all my projects and code.  
- To practice good web-development habits (design, responsiveness, deployment).  

## 🧰 Built With  
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- React, Vite
- Vercel

## 📚 What’s Included  
- An “About Me” section — background, interests, and what I’m studying.  
- A “Projects” section — show a gallery or list of projects, with descriptions, links, and live demos (if deployed).  
- A “Skills & Technologies” section — enumerate languages, frameworks, tools I’m confident with.  
- Contact / social links — email, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.
